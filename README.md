### Hey, I'm Emily
I'm a brooklyn-based language nerd interested in NLP, data visualization, and ethical machine learning. I got my start studying linguistics at the [University of Texas](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/linguistics), went on to do machine translation research at [LTI @ Carnegie Mellon](https://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/), and I've been working as a software engineer in ML and localization ever since.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning D3 and NextJS in order to make beautiful, interactive data visualizations
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about language models, distributional semantics, and opinions on pop music
